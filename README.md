# MRE-simplified-promedas
MRE implementation for simplified promedas bayesian network

At the bottom of the file the call is made to compute the MRE of the given evidence.
The evidence list at the top are some sample evidence that can be used.
NOTE: the disease variables cannot be used as evidence, only the symptons/findings.
Above the MRE function call, there is a variable called 'evi' which can be used to select different evidence.
